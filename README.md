## What is this about? <a name = "about"></a>
Have you just started your investment journey and wondered how much to invest? Did you follow promising strategies but still see your account in red? Are you worried about the risk that you cannot foresee in your holdings? If you are nodding along these questions, know that you are not alone. In fact, these are what professionals like quants, traders, and asset managers wonder but fail in solving all the time- one often enters the market with a correct timing at a correct price but walks out with a flat wallet, and worse off, margin debt. The Quantitative Risk Dashboard is a research tool that helps users demystify risk prospects of any U.S. listed stocks and identifies the statistical edge of any portfolio investments. It completes these tasks through delivering results from the risk modeling, position tracking, and portfolio optimization tactics. Users of the dashboard are expected to enter the market with a statistical edge, while being reminded about the key question- how much are you prepared to lose?
